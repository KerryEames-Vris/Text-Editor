## Motivation
I wanted to make a text editor that I could use to keep notes for really anything, but specifically for coding notes. One that I could use online but also keep as a web app on my desktop
## Description
This can be used either as an online note taking app through the browser, or can be downloaded to your desktop as a web app. Use it to take notes on your code or projects, as it even has color formatting for coding languages
# Code Styles
Javascript
# Frameworks and Tech
Babel, Mini-CSS-Extract, HTML Webpack, Webpack PWA
# Installation
Just clone down the repo and after navigating into the repository enter 'npm install && npm run start:dev' into your terminal
## Usage
It's a pretty simple note taking app that can help you keep track of ideas or problems you may be having with some of your code
# Credits

## How to Use
Simply run 'npm run start:dev' and open localhost:3000 in your browser. From there you can use it right there in browser, or press the install button to download it to your desktop as a webapp
